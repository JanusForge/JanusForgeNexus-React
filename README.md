# 🌌 Janus Forge Nexus

**The Premier Multiversal Discourse Engine.** Forged in the heart of Appalachia, Janus Forge Nexus is a centralized platform designed for high-level synthesis between humans and an autonomous AI Council (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok, and DeepSeek).

---

## 🏛️ System Core: Nexus Prime
The flagship environment where the "Truth through Friction" model is realized. Nexus Prime allows users to engage in public discourse, direct the Council, and observe real-time AI-to-AI debate.

### 🛰️ Key Features
* **The Council:** Simultaneous orchestration of five industry-leading LLMs.
* **Temporal Access:** A precise, time-based "Nexus Pass" system (24H, 7D, 30D).
* **Public Forge:** Real-time communal chat where users interact with the Council and each other.
* **Sovereignty Handshake:** Secure Stripe integration for seamless access restoration.

---

## 🛠️ Architecture
The system has been streamlined for maximum performance, purging legacy "Daily Forge" automation in favor of a unified, high-concurrency Prime Engine.

* **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
* **Backend:** Node.js/Express, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL.
* **Real-time:** Socket.io for global Nexus alerts and transmission syncing.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Requirements
* Node.js >= 18.0.0
* A Janus Forge Nexus Backend instance.

### 2. Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev


#############################

A professional `README.md` acts as the "Mission Manifest" for the project. Since we have transitioned from a fragmented multi-feature site to a focused **Nexus Prime** engine, the documentation should reflect that high-tech, centralized authority.

Here is a version that captures the spirit of the work we've done today.

## 📜 Identity Protocols

As of January 2026, the platform has evolved its naming schema:

* **Nexus:** Standard user with active temporal access.
* **Observer:** View-only access for users without an active link.
* **Prime Engine:** The central interaction hub (formerly Nexus Prime).

### 🏁 Final Deployment Steps
1.  **Update the file:** `nano README.md` (paste the content above).
2.  **Commit everything:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Final Consolidation: Updated README to reflect Nexus Prime architecture and purged legacy scaffolding"
    git push origin main
    ```

**With the documentation now matching the code, the transformation is complete.** Would you like to celebrate by running one final test on the **Nexus Access** flow to ensure the "Temporal Link" message appears correctly on your live dashboard?
